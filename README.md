The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
First, I imported the data provided in the establishments.json file from my Terminal and created the uk_food database and establishments collection which were then assigned to variables for later use.

## Part 2: Update the Database
Next, I inserted the data of a new restaurant into the collection, updated it, removed any establishments within the Dover Local Authority from the database and converted the data type for the latitude and longitude fields from string to float.

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Lastly, I answered the 4 specific questions provided by Eat Safe, Love by making the relevant queries, pretty printing the results and converting them to data frames.
